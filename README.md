## OWL Hobby

자신이 하고 있는 취미를 다른 사람과 같이 할 수 있도록 만남을 주선해주는 사이트입니다

It's a website that arranges meetings so that you can share your hobbies with others.

## Motivation

동네에 친구가 없는데 취미를 함께 할 수 있는 사람들을 모으고 싶었기 때문이고 기존의 동네 친구를 만들어주는 사이트는 주로 이성과의 만남을 연결하기에 우리의 사이트는 동성 / 이성 / 상관없음 의 옵션을 부여할 것입니다.

Because we don't have any friends in the neighborhood, we want to gather people who can share our hobbies, and the site that makes friends in the neighborhood usually connects with the opposite sex, so our site will have the option of same sex/sex/don't care.
